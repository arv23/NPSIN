National Park Services Instant Navigator 
Developed at Drexel University Sept 2009-June 2010
Dev Team: Alejandro Valdes, Scott Landau, Christopher Fagan, Bradford Dorman

This was built when the iPhone ran on iOS 3, so it is pretty outdated, but this remains here just as a reference/portfolio.

NPSIN was an iPhone app to showoff the park's sites and features with GPS locations and media displaying.

Detailed info along with videos of the app can be viewed at http://alejandrorvaldes.wordpress.com/npsin/.

This app was built with XCode and the Cocoa Touch framework.
